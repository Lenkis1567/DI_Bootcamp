Hi Elena,
in exercises 2 you get the error:


 line 41, in incredible_presentation
    print (f'Name: , {one_person["name"]}, power: {one_person ["incredible_name"]}')
KeyError: 'incredible_name'

The error is raised because in the Incredibles class self_members list, 
the key 'incredible_name' is used, but in the incredible_presentation method,
the key used is 'incredible_name' instead of 'incredible_name'.

To fix this error, you can change the key used in the incredible_presentation method to 'incredible_name' as follows:
print (f'Name: {one_person["name"]}, power: {one_person["incredible_name"]}')

Also, when creating a new member in the Incredibles class, you should use
self.members.append(new_member) instead of self_members.append(new_member) to add the new member to
the list of members of the Family class.

hope this helps!
