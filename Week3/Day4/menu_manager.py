class MenuManager:
    __init__() - The function should read the menu from the restaurant_menu.json file and store it in a variable called menu.

    def add_item(name, price):
        pass
    #  – this method should add an item to the menu, although do not save the changes to the file yet.

    def remove_item(name):
        pass 
    # – if the item is in the menu, this function should remove it from the menu 
    # (and again do not save the changes to the file yet) and return True. If the item was not in the menu, 
    # return False. (Hint: use Python’s del operator).
    def_save_to_file():
        pass

    # - When the manager is finished updating the menu this function should be called and it should save 
    # all the updates and write them into the the restaurant_menu.json file (ie. the file which holds the menu).
