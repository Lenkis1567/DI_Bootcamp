You did a great job with the first daily challage!
i saw you didnt do the second daily challenge so ill provide you with some hints...

def affordable_items(items_purchase, wallet):
    # Convert wallet to a float without the dollar sign
    wallet_amount = float(wallet[1:].replace(',', ''))
    
    # Create an empty list to store affordable items
    affordable_items = []
    
    # Check each item in items_purchase
    for item, price in items_purchase.items():
        # Convert the price to a float without the dollar sign and commas
        item_price = float(price[1:].replace(',', ''))
        if item_price <= wallet_amount:
            affordable_items.append(item)
    
Now try doing the last 2 steps by urself which are:    
    
    # Sort the affordable_items list in alphabetical order
   
    
    # Return the list or "Nothing" if the list is empty
    
Goodluck! we can go through it together tomorrow at the session if you desire.
